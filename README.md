munin-plugins
=============

Some munin plugins that i felt were missing or not what i was looking for in the public repository.

ipvs_conns - connections
ipvs_bytes - bytes
ipvs_packets - yeah you guessed right ;)
ipvs_state - This is what i was after, something that lets you guess how close you are to filling up your ipvs connection hash table, the new default seems to be 2^20=1mio entries btw.
